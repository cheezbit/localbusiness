Stay Local
====

Stay Local is a chrome extension that allows users to differentiate which businesses are local since they have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This will make it easier for consumers to support their community. Learn more on our [website](https://local-businesss.web.app/)! 

Stay Local also shows which businesses are black-owned. Black people have faced many injustices in America and the world and supporting local, black-owned businesses can go a long way.
